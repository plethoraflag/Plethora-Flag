	<h3><i>Dec 2, 2019</i></h3>
	<p>Well, I think we all knew this whole "blog every two weeks" thing wasn't gonna work out.</p>
	<p>Today I submit my very first app to the App Store. After six months of learning and practicing, I am finally ready to enter the App Store world with <b>The Burn Book.</b></p>
	<p>The Burn Book is a simple app designed for a simple purpose - insulting people. Generate 150+ insults and read up on tips to up your insult game.</p>
	<p>It should be out very soon.</p>

	<h3><i>May 4, 2019</h3></i>
	<p>I quit my day job! I did that thing most people tell you not to do. I like risks. I feel like they’re necessary. For what I’m gonna do, it’s definitely necessary. I can’t wait to get started on Kickpad full time! For now, though, I am enjoying the rest of my vacation week.</p>
	<p>Business will be picking up here very shortly. Substantial and worthwhile updates are coming soon, I promise. Join me on this road we’re about to go down! Check in here every so often, it’s gonna get really cool pretty soon. I can’t wait to tell you all about Kickpad.</p>

	<h3><i>Apr 20, 2019</i></h3>
	<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
	<p>I can now this say this website is where I want it to be (for now). I'm sticking with the minimal design for the forseeable future because I dig it. Now I'm back to working on Kickpad for iOS. In the meantime, I intend on updating this blog at least every two weeks.</p>
	<p>See ya around.</p>
	<p>- Brian</p>

	<h3><i>Apr 19, 2019</i></h3>
	<p><a href="http://kickpad.app">Kickpad.app</a> launched last night, even though it's empty at the moment. In its wake, this morning comes plethoraflag.com. This will be a blog for (1) recording professional and personal progress, (2) release notes (eventually), (3) company transparency, and (4) because I'm sure it'll be fun to look back on some day.</p>
	<p>If you're reading this - hi there! Thanks for stoppin' by. Wish me luck.</p>
